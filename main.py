# Exercise 07: FizzBuzz Exercise
# Write a function that takes 1 number as argument. 
# The function should return “Fizz” if the number is divisible by 3, 
# the function should return “Buzz” if the number is divisible by 5, 
# the function should return “FizzBuzz” if the number is divisible by both 5 and 3,
# otherwise return “Not a Fizz-buzz number”
# Hints: Use condition inside the function
